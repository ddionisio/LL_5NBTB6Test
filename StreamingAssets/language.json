    "intro_alert_0": "Danger!",
    "intro_alert_1": "Multiple blobs of epic proportion detected!",
    "intro_alert_2": "It seems these blobs came from a lab, and have somehow grown uncontrollably.",
    "intro_alert_3": "We must find a way to shrink them back!",
    "intro_op_0": "According to the latest studies of blobology, the only way to shrink them is by the power of the divide operation.",
    "intro_op_1": "Divide and conquer, as they say!",
    "intro_op_2": "Go forth, our intrepid hero! Use your mathematical might to vanquish these menacing blobs!",
    "lesson1_intro_0": "Dividing a large number can be daunting, but with the right trick, it can be a breeze!",
    "lesson1_intro_1": "Let’s briefly examine a useful mathematical principle to help us.",
    "lesson1_placeValue_0": "First, let’s take a quick look at how large numbers are arranged by single digit numbers.",
    "lesson1_placeValue_1": "These digits are placed by multiples of 10’s, since we use a base 10 number system.",
    "lesson1_placeValueDistribute_0": "Now with that in mind, we can split the dividend up by this principle.",
    "lesson1_placeValueDistribute_1": "Splitting up a number to be added later is known as the distributive property.",
    "lesson1_placeValueDistribute_2": "Pay close attention to how the distributive property works!",
    "lesson1_end_0": "Let’s go ahead and put this into practice when we face the mega blob!",
    "lesson2_intro_0": "This time around, we will be dividing with double-digit divisors.",
    "lesson2_intro_1": "It would be too troublesome to deal with these blobs using our current technique.",
    "lesson2_intro_2": "Fortunately, we have one more trick up our sleeves!",
    "lesson2_areaModel_0": "Since division is the inverse of multiplication, you can visualize the equation as the dimensions of an area.",
    "lesson2_areaModel_1": "In this case, the quotient of the division is the width of the area.",
    "lesson2_areaModelDistribute_0": "We can use this model to partially solve the division with smaller numbers.",
    "lesson2_areaModelDistribute_1": "Observe how the area is being split into two.",
    "lesson2_areaModelDistribute_2": "Adding the split values will then give you the whole answer.",
    "lesson2_end_0": "Now why don’t we try this new technique with the next mega blob!",
    "level1_intro_0": "Look out! Two blobs have appeared.",
    "level1_intro_1": "In order to beat the mega blob, we must merge all the blobs into one final quotient blob.",
    "level1_intro_2": "Those numbers don’t look that scary. We can directly solve the division.",
    "instruct_drag_blob_0": "In order to merge the two blobs, simply drag one to another like so.",
    "op_instruct_0": "Now you must solve the operation by typing in the number via the numpad.",
    "op_instruct_1": "You can also use the keyboard to enter the numbers.",
    "op_instruct_2": "Once you feel confident with your answer, press the ENTER button on the numpad (or your keyboard).",
    "attack_instruct_success_0": "Excellent! We’ve managed to clear the blobs!",
    "attack_instruct_boss_hp_0": "This is the representation of the mega blob’s health.",
    "attack_instruct_boss_hp_1": "As you can see, it has been reduced.",
    "attack_instruct_boss_hp_2": "Once it’s empty, the mega blob will be defeated.",
    "split_instruct_0": "Now we are dealing with a much larger blob!",
    "split_instruct_1": "Let’s split the blob up into two to make our life easier.",
    "split_instruct_2": "Press the sparkly blob as shown to proceed.",
    "split_op_instruct_0": "Here you can see a representation of how the blob is going to be split.",
    "split_op_instruct_1": "We will be splitting the blob by transferring its digits to a new blob.",
    "split_op_instruct_2": "Simply click on any of the digits to transfer them.",
    "split_op_instruct_3": "Once you are happy with the new split numbers, press the SPLIT button.",
    "split_op_instruct_4": "Remember, both new numbers must be wholly divisible for the split to succeed!",
    "split_op_success_0": "Nicely done! The blobs have now been split into two.",
    "split_op_success_1": "You can split the blobs further if you want, but there’s a limit!",
    "split_op_success_2": "Once all the blobs have been merged into the final quotient blob, we will be able to attack.",
    "split_op_success_3": "Good luck!",
    "level3_intro_0": "Watch out! These blobs are not to be trifled with!",
    "split_instruct2_0": "Just as you have done many times before, go ahead a press the sparkly blob.",
    "split_op_partial_instruct_0": "Here we are going to reduce the blob’s large number by multiplying the divisor with a number.",
    "split_op_partial_instruct_1": "First you must specify the number to multiply the divisor. Simply type in the number, and press ENTER.",
    "split_op_partial_next_instruct_0": "Now you must type in the correct answer for the multiplication.",
    "split_op_partial_next_instruct_1": "Once you press ENTER, you’ll see that number subtracted from the dividend blob.",
    "split_op_partial_next_instruct_2": "If the resulting value is less than zero, then try again with a smaller multiplication number!",
    "split_op_partial_success_0": "Good! The blob’s value has been reduced, and a partial quotient blob has appeared.",
    "split_op_partial_success_1": "Splitting up large numbers this way will make it easier to deal with two or more-digit divisors!",
    "split_op_partial_success_2": "I’ve said everything that I can to help you, the rest is up to you. Go forth, and defeat the mega blobs!",
    "end_congrats": "CONGRATULATIONS!",
    "end_desc": "You have vanquished all the mega blobs! Peace has returned to the world once more!",
    "end_thanks": "Thank you for playing!"
